                  To stream on bitwave.tv you first need a streaming software. I put the buttons below to make it easy for you.
                </div>
                <div class="mb-3">
                  For PC you can use <span class="font-weight-bold yellow--text">OBS Studio</span> or <span class="font-weight-bold blue--text">Streamlabs</span>.
                  But you should probably use OBS Studio. It generally has better performance, despite not being as fancy looking.
                  Additionally you may be interested in wasting hours of your life attempting to install, remove, re-install, configure, diagnose, setup, use, then reinstalling
                  <span class="font-weight-bold red--text">Voicemeeter</span>, which allows you to attempt to manage audio routing for streaming entirely in software.
                </div>

                <div class="mb-3">
                  Once you've made it that far, you'll just want to make sure of a few settings in OBS. Mostly just 1 setting, and that is your
                  <span class="font-weight-bold">keyframes</span>. You'll want to make sure you have those set to 1.
                </div>

                <div class="mb-3">
                  Ensuring keyframes are set properly will be the best chance you have at having a somewhat decent stream.
                  By default it is set to 0 or automatic, which, on average, causes at least an additional 30 second stream delay
                  and in extreme cases, may be up to an additioanal 45 seconds. Which is pretty bad.

            <div>1. What is the delay?</div>
            First, verify your keyframes are correct.
            This will give you about a <span class="font-weight-bold white--text">10 to 20 second</span> delay.
            <br><span class="title">If</span> you are having issues with delay, trying moving somewhere with actual internet. . .
            or using an ethernet cord, decreasing resolution/bitrate,
            enabling low latency mode, or just giving up entirely like everything else you tried and failed at in life.

              Bumps or Bumpers (I'm not 100% sure which it is).
