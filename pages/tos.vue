        <p>
          This Bitwave Terms of Service Agreement (the "Agreement" or "Terms of Service") is made between Bitwave ("bitwave", "bitwave.tv", "bitwave media", "we", "us", or "our") and you, our customer ("you" or "your").
          Bitwave provides live streaming services through our owned-and-operated websites, applications, and embeddable video players (collectively, the "Services").
