        <h1>WAVECOIN ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY ( WC-AUP )</h1>

        <v-divider class="mt-1 mb-3" color="primary" />

        <p>
          Bitwave WaveCoins are digital content (i.e., highlighted and colored text, animated emotes)
          that can only be purchased from Bitwave Media. Bitwave WaveCoins may not and technologically
          cannot be transferred outside of Bitwave Media’s web application.
        </p>
        <p>
          We must introduce and establish a clear and common understanding of how Bitwave WaveCoins
          can serve users on Bitwave. We must additionally identify activities that are prohibited
          with Bitwave WaveCoins. Publishing this Acceptable Coin Use Policy (“WC-AUP”)
          is an effort to achieve that goal.
        </p>


        <h2>Application</h2>
        <p>
          This Policy applies to any Bitwave streamer or Bitwave viewer that purchases, obtains,
          interacts with, engages with, or otherwise uses Bitwave WaveCoins. We may change this Policy
          from time to time with such changes effective upon posting online or otherwise providing you an
          updated version. We encourage you to routinely review this Policy to stay informed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your use of Bitwave WaveCoins is further subject to and governed by Bitwave’s Terms of
          Service and Privacy Policy. In the event of a conflict between this Policy and other
          agreements with Bitwave WaveCoins, this Policy shall control.
        </p>

        <h2>Usage Guidelines</h2>
        <p>
          These base principals must be understood and respected at all times when involved with
          Bitwave WaveCoins, whether you are the streamer, viewers, or any other ancillary party,
          remember:

            or for receiving a Bitwave WaveCoins alert.
            <br /><br />HOWEVER, in each of those scenarios, the activity does NOT
            provide a return of anything of value. An EXPERIENCE does not in and of
            itself have any real value.
          </p>
